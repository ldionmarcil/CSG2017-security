Context
-------
This module describes our cryptographic stack. We describe the algorithm used to
store passwords and mission critical data. We hired some top-shelf consultant
from Stratfor to develop this algorithm, so it should be pretty legit.

MODULE DEPRECATED! Do not use this! It's CRAPTOGRAPHY! 


Deprecation
-----------
We do not use this module anymore, as it was proven to be vulnerable! However,
we haven't taken the time to reset any passwords because we were too busy
playing ping-pong.
